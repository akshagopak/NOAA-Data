Predicts the possibility of precipitations, which involves using various local climatological variables, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure.
The data you will be handling was collected by an NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York. 

Objectives:

1. Modify a data frame and store the modified data in a new variable containing the new data frame
2. Clean the data by converting categorical values to numeric values
3. Evaluate the model by training and testing the data
4. Create histograms and boxplots of the training set data
5. Analyze the training set data visually to look for patterns and trends
6. Analyze the training set data using linear and polynomial regression
7. Compare and contrast the different models to determine the best fit using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R-squared
8. Improve the generalization of the polynomial models using regularization
9. Evaluate the weather data analysis project developed by your peers using the provided rubric and grading scheme
